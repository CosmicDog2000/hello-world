My first GitHub repository.

Hi!

This is Jonathan, sometimes known as CosmicDog. I've been coding off and on for awhile, mostly off. I like VBA and python. I'm learning javascript (going through freeCodeCamp). It's lots of fun; I'm having a great time, even if I am staying up all night working on projects and challenges.
